          <h1>Pakistan's Renowned Physicist :</h1>
          <p>
            Abdul Qadeer Khan (born April 1, 1936, Bhopal, India—died October
            10, 2021, Islamabad, Pakistan) was a Pakistani engineer, a key
            figure in Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program who was also involved
            for decades in a black market of nuclear technology and know-how
            whereby uranium-enrichment centrifuges, nuclear warhead designs,
            missiles, and expertise were sold or traded to Iran, North Korea,
            Libya, and possibly other countries. In 1947, during Khan’s
            childhood, India achieved independence from Britain, and Muslim
            areas in the east and west were partitioned to form the state of
            Pakistan. Khan immigrated to West Pakistan in 1952, and in 1960 he
            graduated from the University of Karachi with a degree in
            metallurgy. Over the next decade he pursued graduate studies abroad,
            first in West Berlin and then in Delft, Netherlands, where in 1967
            he received a master’s degree in metallurgy. In 1972 he earned a
            doctorate in metallurgical engineering from the Catholic University
            of Leuven in Belgium. Meanwhile, in 1964 he married Hendrina
            Reterink, a British national who had been born to Dutch expatriate
            parents in South Africa and raised in what was then Northern
            Rhodesia (now Zambia) before moving to the Netherlands.

            Khan was pardoned by Musharraf after his confession but later
            retracted his remarks. “I saved the country for the first time when
            I made Pakistan a nuclear nation and saved it again when I confessed
            and took the whole blame on myself,” Khan told AFP news agency in an
            interview in 2008 while under effective house arrest.The scientist
            believed in nuclear defence as the best deterrent. After Pakistan
            carried out atomic tests in 1998 in response to tests by India, Khan
            said Pakistan “never wanted to make nuclear weapons, it was forced
            to do so”. Nearly a decade ago, Khan tried his luck in the political
            arena, forming a party – the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Pakistan (Save
            Pakistan Movement) – in July 2012 in hopes of winning votes on the
            basis of the respect he still commands in Pakistan. But he dissolved
            it a year later after none of its 111 candidates won a seat in
            national elections. Khan also stirred a new controversy that same
            year when, in an interview with Urdu newspaper Daily Jang, he said
            he transferred nuclear technology to two countries on the direction
            of slain prime minister Benazir Bhutto. He did not name the
            countries, nor did he say when Bhutto, the twice-elected PM who was
            assassinated in 2007, had supposedly issued the orders.

            <mark style="background-color: rgb(220, 220, 170)"
              >“I was not independent but was bound to abide by the orders of
              the prime minister,” he was quoted as saying. Bhutto’s Pakistan
              Peoples Party denied the claim as “baseless and unfounded”.</mark
            >

            None of the controversies appear to have dented Khan’s popularity,
            even years on. He regularly wrote op-ed pieces, often preaching the
            value of a scientific education, for the popular Jang group of
            newspapers.
